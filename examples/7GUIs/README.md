# 7GUIs in flimflam

"7GUIs" is a programming usability benchmark for GUI libraries. 

Flimflam is a pattern for creating GUIs using functional programming.

Each directory here constitues a single 7GUIs example. Each example has a set of tests in its /test/ directory.

These are still in progress. Still to do are flight booker, circle drawer, and cells.

- [Counter](/examples/7GUIs/counter)
- [Converter](/examples/7GUIs/converter)
- [Flight Booker](/examples/7GUIs/flight-booker)
- [Timer](/examples/7GUIs/timer)
- [CRUD](/examples/7GUIs/crud)
- [Circle Drawer](/examples/7GUIs/circle-drawer)
- [Cells](/examples/7GUIs/cells)

There is a README.md and test/index.js file within each example/directory with more details.
